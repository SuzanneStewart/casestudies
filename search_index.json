Assessing two video case studies (Schizophrenia and Anxiety) and one written case study (Sleep) Discussing relevant symptoms, other associated experiences, and aetiological &amp; maintenance factors for each case Discussing the perspectives of the client and and the practitioner in the video case studies Discussing relevant treatments for each case 1.0.2 What are the aims of this session? To apply knowledge of the portfolio topics in assessing and evaluating client case studies To improve practical skills relevant for working in clinical settings To discuss the case studies and relevant therapies with other students 1.0.3 What should I do? Take notes for each case study of EVIDENCE (i.e., what does the client say or describe about their experiences?) SYMPTOMS and FACTORS (i.e., from a practitioner perspectve, what symptom or relevant factor does the evidence demonstrate for example, worry, hallucinations, stressors, etc.?) TIMINGS (i.e., durations of experiences; frequency of experiences) IMPACT and FUNCTIONING (i.e., what negative effects on the client's life have occurred as a result of the experiences?) After each case study section, discuss with a partner what you wrote down and what it means from both the service user and practitioner perspectives At the very end of each case, discuss with a partner some overall considerations, such as what interventions might be relevant. You'll be given some guidance to help you. 1.0.4 Trigger warning Some content does refer to sensitive areas such as assessing self-harm and suicidal intent Please take your usual precautions as necessary -- feel free to distract yourself during those portions, take a break, look away, etc. "],

["anxiety-introduction.html", "7 Anxiety -- Introduction", " 7 Anxiety -- Introduction Now we'll move on to the Anxiety Case Study. The next video is of Julie who is seeing her GP due to her anxiety. You had quite a bit of support with the last case study -- now that you've got experience of one, there will be less support this time. We'll still pause the video so you can take notes and discuss just a little bit at a time, but we won't be providing any answers for you. Thus, it's really important that you keep taking notes of EVIDENCE (i.e., what does the client say or describe about their experiences?)

["sleep-introduction.html", "11 Sleep -- Introduction", " 11 Sleep -- Introduction Now we'll move on to the Sleep Case Study. For this last case study, you'll get a little less support -- it's a written case study rather than a video one. You won't get information from the client's non-verbal communication or from their own words. You'll also need to figure out how to work with the information you do have, and what information you'd ideally like to know. This last case study, therefore, is most similar to what you need to do for your coursework. We hope that this practice is helpful! The case study is about Kitty who is seeing her GP due to her insomnia. Your first job is to write down a list of opening questions for Kitty. What would you want to ask her to find out about her sleep difficulty? Think of two questions for each of the following categories (on your own or with a partner): EVIDENCE SYMPTOMS AND FACTORS TIMINGS IMPACT AND FUNCTIONING "],

With your partner (or on your own if you prefer), analyse it for information relating to your questions, as well as other pieces of helpful information relating to Kitty's experiences. Kitty -- Part 1 Kitty is a 28-year old woman who has come to see her GP about her sleep. She is a single mum who co-parents her four-year old son. While she has a good relationship with her ex-partner, she struggles to balance caring for her son, the co-parenting schedule with her ex, and her business. She is self-employed as a children’s party entertainer, for which she organises baking and craft parties. Thus, she tends to work more on weekends and during school holidays. She has worried about her finances, particularly as she has been saving to move to a bigger flat as her son has grown, and while her business has been doing well, it has been a lot more work than she had anticipated.

With your partner (or on your own if you prefer), analyse it for information relating to your questions, as well as other pieces of helpful information relating to Kitty's experiences. Kitty -- Part 2 Kitty explains to her GP that her sleep problems began about eight months ago and have steadily grown worse over that timeframe. After her son goes to sleep around 7:00 PM, she spends two or three hours working on billing, organising her diary, advertising, and ordering supplies. She usually then watches videos on YouTube or scrolls through social media for about half an hour before going to bed. Kitty reports that she tends to take around two hours to fall asleep and sleeps well until around 3 or 4 AM, when she wakes up. She then tosses and turns for an hour or two before giving up and getting up for the day. This happens on most nights of the week. Her son tends to wake up around 6:30 AM but usually sleeps through the night. "],

With your partner (or on your own if you prefer), analyse it for information relating to your questions, as well as other pieces of helpful information relating to Kitty's experiences. Kitty -- Part 3 Upon questioning, Kitty’s GP finds out that she sometimes falls asleep at her desk after lunchtime, though she doesn’t sleep for very long. She has become afraid that she will fall asleep while driving, especially when her son is in the car, so she has started avoiding driving as much as possible. Kitty also says that, recently, she has started getting easily irritated with her son and finds it hard to relax or engage in quiet activities with him such as reading a book or doing a jigsaw puzzle. She also reports that she has begun making mistakes with her business activities, such as forgetting to include certain charges on her clients' invoices. Kitty's avoidance of driving, her worry about making mistakes relating to her business, and her irritation with her son are what motivated her to see her GP. "],

We hope you found them helpful in applying knowledge you've learned thus far, in trying out some practical skills relevant to clinical psychology, and (for many of you) in thinking about the Psychopathology assessment.
